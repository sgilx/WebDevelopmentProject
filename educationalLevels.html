                    <p>BSN is the most known option in Nursing. BSN programs are designed to help individuals attain 
                        a bachelor's degree within the healthcare umbrella and become a Registered Nurse(RN). BSN's but 
                        also complete the NCLEX to become properly certified. Having a BSN increases your chances of 
                        attaining higher pay, more opportunities, and employers prefer those with BSNs but it is not typically required. </p>

                <div id="educationSec-2">
                    <p>RN is a licensed individual who also holds an associate degree. RN's, or Registered Nurses, 
                        work under their healthcare team. This includes other physicians such as RT's, Doctors, etc. 
                        RN's are those who typically work in schools, doctors offices, clinics, or hospitals. Those 
                        pursuing an RN licensure must also pass the NCLEX.</p>

                    <p>Technically speaking, CNA's are not nurses. They are 
                        assistants. Hence their title, Certified Nursing Assistant.
                        However, because they respond to RN's, they are able to gain 
                        essential skills and experience. You are able to learn basic healthcare
                        skills and determine hwether you see yourself being able to further your education
                        and pursue to have a BSN or become an RN.</p>
