            <p>
                Nursing is an in demand job. It is projected to have a positive outlook within the next 8 years,
                increasing by 6%. As of May 2022, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm#tab-1">Bureau of Labor 
                Statistics</a> declared the median pay for an RN is $81,220 per year. This of course varies depending on
                location, experience, etc.

            <p>
                Different units that people can pursue work in once becoming a nurse vary. Some people will pursue a 
                pediatric specialty, critical care, cardiac, labor & delivery, etc. Each of these specialties will require 
                a residency and training in that particular unit. We urge you to consider this in your decision making as well.
                When talking Travel Nursing, we are talking about any specialty of nurse, being expected to travel to any 
                destination necessary where their aid is needed. Pay is much greater, but more is expected. One must be 
                prepared to face new environments, teams, etc. The <a href="https://www.travelnursing.com/news/features-and-profiles/travel-nurse-salary-and-benefits/#:~:text=Salaries%20are%20higher%20for%20travel%20nurses&text=Travel%20nurses%20can%20earn%20%24100%2C000,high%20as%20%2460.00%20per%20hour.">
